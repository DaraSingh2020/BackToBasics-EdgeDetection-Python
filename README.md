# BackToBasics-EdgeDetection-Python
Edge detection algorithms are a fundamental component of image processing and computer vision. They are used to identify the boundaries (edges) of objects within an image, which is a critical step in many computer vision tasks, including object detection, image segmentation, and feature extraction.Here's an overview of how edge detection algorithms work:

**Grayscale Conversion:**

The input color image is typically converted to grayscale. Grayscale images have a single intensity value per pixel, making edge detection simpler and more efficient.
Smoothing (Optional):

Before detecting edges, some algorithms apply a smoothing or blurring filter to the grayscale image. This step helps reduce noise and fine details that can be mistaken for edges. Common filters include Gaussian blur and median blur.

**Gradient Calculation:**

Edge detection algorithms typically calculate the gradient of the image, which represents the rate of change of intensity at each pixel. The gradient is computed by applying convolution operations using a gradient kernel (filter) in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Common gradient operators include the Sobel, Prewitt, and Scharr operators.

**Edge Strength and Orientation:**

From the gradient values, the algorithm computes the edge strength or edge magnitude at each pixel. This is often done using the Euclidean norm (square root of the sum of squared gradient values) or other measures like the absolute values of the gradients. Additionally, the edge detection algorithm can determine the orientation of edges at each pixel. This information is used in some advanced edge detection techniques.

**Edge Thresholding:**

Thresholding is applied to the edge strength values to identify pixels that are part of an edge. Pixels with edge strengths above a certain threshold are considered edge pixels, while those below the threshold are considered non-edge pixels. Thresholding can be binary (strong edge or not) or multi-level, depending on the specific algorithm and application.

**Edge Tracing (Optional):**

In some cases, edge detection algorithms include a step for connecting adjacent edge pixels to form continuous curves or contours. This process is called edge tracing or edge linking.

========================**Common Edge Detection Algorithms**==================

**Canny Edge Detector:**

A popular edge detection algorithm that includes smoothing, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, edge tracking by hysteresis, and thresholding. It produces well-defined and thin edges.

**Sobel Operator:**

A simple gradient-based edge detection method using convolution with Sobel kernels. It emphasizes vertical and horizontal edges.

**Prewitt Operator:**

Similar to the Sobel operator but with a different convolution kernel.

**Scharr Operator:**

Another variant of the Sobel operator, designed to provide better rotational symmetry.

**Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG):**

Combines Gaussian blurring and Laplacian filtering to detect edges by identifying zero crossings in the second derivative of the image.
Edge detection algorithms vary in their computational complexity, noise resistance, and edge detection capabilities. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the computer vision task and the characteristics of the input images.
